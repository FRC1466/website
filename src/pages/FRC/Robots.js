                    2021 was Infinite Recharge at Home. There were 5 robot challenges, and our team went for all of them. 
                    Since there wasn't going to be any defense played, we made our robot very small and fast.
                    Called "Spooky Fast", the bot consisted of a drawer-slide intake and a flywheel shooter on a KOP drivetrain.

                    2020 was Infinite Recharge, a game where you can shoot into a low level, outer high level, or inner high level, with a single telescoping arm climb for endgame.
                    Our robot for 2020 was a dump truck robot with a single telesoping climber in the center of the robot.
